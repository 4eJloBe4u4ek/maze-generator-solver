**Description**

This project is a console-based application for generating and solving mazes. It can generate mazes of various sizes and solution to find a path from a given starting point (A) to an ending point (B), if it exists. The interface is simple and outputs the maze and solution directly in the console.

**Features:**

Configurable maze generation:

* *Customizable terrain types (e.g., bad/good surfaces)*

* *User-defined entry and exit points*

Implementation of two maze generation algorithms:

* *PrimsGenerator*

* *RecursiveBacktrackingGenerator*

Implementation of two pathfinding algorithms:

* *AStarSolver*

* *DijkstraSolver*

Console visualization of the generated maze with start (A) and end (B) points.
